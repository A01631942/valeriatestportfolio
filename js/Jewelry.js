     title: "Alter Ego, three levels of consciousness",
     description1: "Three piece of white gold collection with a Sapphire stone. The collection arises from the concept of transcendental connections, which are made through the soul which has the ability to fragment itself to have several lives in which we create connections with other souls that transcend time and space, souls that are destined to help us grow spiritually and accompany us until we reach our maximum fullness. Each piece represents a part of our consciousness, since there is where all these experiences are stored in different levels.​​​​​​​Manufactured with 3d wax printing and lost wax processes.",
     description2: "Unconscious, the most primitive part of our mind, where thousands of experiences have been stored throughout human history, the unconscious allows us to react instinctively to dangerous situations, to keep us alive. This piece is the most primitive piece, presenting an aggressive aesthetic alluding to instinct and its way of protecting us in alert situations. The subconscious, emotional part of our mind, where neural connections are created with objects and people, where love and affection for continuous coexistence with other people arise. The sapphire, protected by a layer of white gold, just like our subconscious is below our conscious mind, making it harder to know it thoroughly. The conscious, part of our mind in which we make decisions in a logical-rational way. With a sapphire mostly exposed, the conscious mind is the one with the greatest dominance, the one we get to know the most which we get to see more clearly.",
